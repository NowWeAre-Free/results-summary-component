## IMPORTANT ! ! !

I know that's not high quality code, probably not much optimalized but I'm still learnig how to use
BEM methodology and SCSS correctly. I want to leave the code like that because in a few months I will back
to this lines to check if I did a progress.

At the end of this project my mind is about to:
- improve naming classes (BEM)
- define and using more mixins
- improve media query skillset

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS/mixin/partials/media queries/variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- RWD

Thanks for reading, have a nice day!
